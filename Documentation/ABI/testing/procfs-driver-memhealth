What:       /proc/memhealth/oom_victim_list
Date:       July 2023
Contact:    carlosgalo@google.com
Description:
        This attribute shows information about out-of-memory (OOM)
        victims. The format is
        "<timestamp> <pid> <uid> <oom_score_adjusted> <process_name>\n",
        each value is separated by an empty space, and the end of an
        entry is determined by a line break.

        The timestamp field is output in milliseconds. PID has already
        been converted to the root namespace.

        The file is read only, and requires CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability.
        The max file size is calculated by page size and the size of
        the `oom_victim` struct. In the case we hit the max size,
        it will start removing the oldest OOM event entries.

        Example of entries/values::
        45439 618 1000 999 system_server
        46866 1546 0 995 sh
        73596 2401 10025 990 oid.documentsui

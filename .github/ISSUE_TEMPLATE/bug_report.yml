      **Is this the right place for my bug report?**
      This repository contains the Linux kernel used on the Raspberry Pi.
      If you believe that the issue you are seeing is kernel-related, this is the right place.
      If not, we have other repositories for the GPU firmware at [github.com/raspberrypi/firmware](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware) and Raspberry Pi userland applications at [github.com/raspberrypi/userland](https://github.com/raspberrypi/userland).
      
      If you have problems with the Raspbian distribution packages, report them in the [github.com/RPi-Distro/repo](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/repo).
      If you simply have a question, then [the Raspberry Pi forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums) are the best place to ask it.

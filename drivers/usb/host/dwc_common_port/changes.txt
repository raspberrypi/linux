
dwc_read_reg32() and friends now take an additional parameter, a pointer to an
IO context struct. The IO context struct should live in an os-dependent struct
in your driver. As an example, the dwc_usb3 driver has an os-dependent struct
named 'os_dep' embedded in the main device struct. So there these calls look
like this:

	dwc_read_reg32(&usb3_dev->os_dep.ioctx, &pcd->dev_global_regs->dcfg);

	dwc_write_reg32(&usb3_dev->os_dep.ioctx,
			&pcd->dev_global_regs->dcfg, 0);

Note that for the existing Linux driver ports, it is not necessary to actually
define the 'ioctx' member in the os-dependent struct. Since Linux does not
require an IO context, its macros for dwc_read_reg32() and friends do not
use the context pointer, so it is optimized away by the compiler. But it is
necessary to add the pointer parameter to all of the call sites, to be ready
for any future ports (such as FreeBSD) which do require an IO context.


Similarly, dwc_alloc(), dwc_alloc_atomic(), dwc_strdup(), and dwc_free() now
take an additional parameter, a pointer to a memory context. Examples:

	addr = dwc_alloc(&usb3_dev->os_dep.memctx, size);

	dwc_free(&usb3_dev->os_dep.memctx, addr);

Again, for the Linux ports, it is not necessary to actually define the memctx
member, but it is necessary to add the pointer parameter to all of the call
sites.


Same for dwc_dma_alloc() and dwc_dma_free(). Examples:

	virt_addr = dwc_dma_alloc(&usb3_dev->os_dep.dmactx, size, &phys_addr);

	dwc_dma_free(&usb3_dev->os_dep.dmactx, size, virt_addr, phys_addr);


Same for dwc_mutex_alloc() and dwc_mutex_free(). Examples:

	mutex = dwc_mutex_alloc(&usb3_dev->os_dep.mtxctx);

	dwc_mutex_free(&usb3_dev->os_dep.mtxctx, mutex);


Same for dwc_spinlock_alloc() and dwc_spinlock_free(). Examples:

	lock = dwc_spinlock_alloc(&usb3_dev->osdep.splctx);

	dwc_spinlock_free(&usb3_dev->osdep.splctx, lock);


Same for dwc_timer_alloc(). Example:

	timer = dwc_timer_alloc(&usb3_dev->os_dep.tmrctx, "dwc_usb3_tmr1",
				cb_func, cb_data);


Same for dwc_waitq_alloc(). Example:

	waitq = dwc_waitq_alloc(&usb3_dev->os_dep.wtqctx);


Same for dwc_thread_run(). Example:

	thread = dwc_thread_run(&usb3_dev->os_dep.thdctx, func,
				"dwc_usb3_thd1", data);


Same for dwc_workq_alloc(). Example:

	workq = dwc_workq_alloc(&usb3_dev->osdep.wkqctx, "dwc_usb3_wkq1");


Same for dwc_task_alloc(). Example:

	task = dwc_task_alloc(&usb3_dev->os_dep.tskctx, "dwc_usb3_tsk1",
			      cb_func, cb_data);


In addition to the context pointer additions, a few core functions have had
other changes made to their parameters:

The 'flags' parameter to dwc_spinlock_irqsave() and dwc_spinunlock_irqrestore()
has been changed from a uint64_t to a dwc_irqflags_t.

dwc_thread_should_stop() now takes a 'dwc_thread_t *' parameter, because the
FreeBSD equivalent of that function requires it.

And, in addition to the context pointer, dwc_task_alloc() also adds a
'char *name' parameter, to be consistent with dwc_thread_run() and
dwc_workq_alloc(), and because the FreeBSD equivalent of that function
requires a unique name.


Here is a complete list of the core functions that now take a pointer to a
context as their first parameter:

	dwc_read_reg32
	dwc_read_reg64
	dwc_write_reg32
	dwc_write_reg64
	dwc_modify_reg32
	dwc_modify_reg64
	dwc_alloc
	dwc_alloc_atomic
	dwc_strdup
	dwc_free
	dwc_dma_alloc
	dwc_dma_free
	dwc_mutex_alloc
	dwc_mutex_free
	dwc_spinlock_alloc
	dwc_spinlock_free
	dwc_timer_alloc
	dwc_waitq_alloc
	dwc_thread_run
	dwc_workq_alloc
	dwc_task_alloc     Also adds a 'char *name' as its 2nd parameter

And here are the core functions that have other changes to their parameters:

	dwc_spinlock_irqsave      'flags' param is now a 'dwc_irqflags_t *'
	dwc_spinunlock_irqrestore 'flags' param is now a 'dwc_irqflags_t'
	dwc_thread_should_stop    Adds a 'dwc_thread_t *' parameter



The changes to the core functions also require some of the other library
functions to change:

	dwc_cc_if_alloc() and dwc_cc_if_free() now take a 'void *memctx'
	(for memory allocation) as the 1st param and a 'void *mtxctx'
	(for mutex allocation) as the 2nd param.

	dwc_cc_clear(), dwc_cc_add(), dwc_cc_change(), dwc_cc_remove(),
	dwc_cc_data_for_save(), and dwc_cc_restore_from_data() now take a
	'void *memctx' as the 1st param.

	dwc_dh_modpow(), dwc_dh_pk(), and dwc_dh_derive_keys() now take a
	'void *memctx' as the 1st param.

	dwc_modpow() now takes a 'void *memctx' as the 1st param.

	dwc_alloc_notification_manager() now takes a 'void *memctx' as the
	1st param and a 'void *wkqctx' (for work queue allocation) as the 2nd
	param, and also now returns an integer value that is non-zero if
	allocation of its data structures or work queue fails.

	dwc_register_notifier() now takes a 'void *memctx' as the 1st param.

	dwc_memory_debug_start() now takes a 'void *mem_ctx' as the first
	param, and also now returns an integer value that is non-zero if
	allocation of its data structures fails.



Other miscellaneous changes:

The DEBUG_MEMORY and DEBUG_REGS #define's have been renamed to
DWC_DEBUG_MEMORY and DWC_DEBUG_REGS.

The following #define's have been added to allow selectively compiling library
features:

	DWC_CCLIB
	DWC_CRYPTOLIB
	DWC_NOTIFYLIB
	DWC_UTFLIB

A DWC_LIBMODULE #define has also been added. If this is not defined, then the
module code in dwc_common_linux.c is not compiled in. This allows linking the
library code directly into a driver module, instead of as a standalone module.

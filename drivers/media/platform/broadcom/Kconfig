	  Say Y here to enable support for the BCM283x/BCM271x CSI-2 receiver.
	  This is a V4L2 driver that controls the CSI-2 receiver directly,
	  independently from the VC4 firmware.

	  This driver is mutually exclusive with the use of bcm2835-camera. The
	  firmware will disable all access to the peripheral from within the
	  firmware if it finds a DT node using it, and bcm2835-camera will
	  therefore fail to probe.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module will be
	  called bcm2835-unicam.

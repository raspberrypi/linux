Introduction
============

This directory contains Device Tree overlays. Device Tree makes it possible
to support many hardware configurations with a single kernel and without the
need to explicitly load or blacklist kernel modules. Note that this isn't a
"pure" Device Tree configuration (c.f. MACH_BCM2835) - some on-board devices
are still configured by the board support code, but the intention is to
eventually reach that goal.

On Raspberry Pi, Device Tree usage is controlled from /boot/config.txt. By
default, the Raspberry Pi kernel boots with device tree enabled. You can
completely disable DT usage (for now) by adding:

    device_tree=

to your config.txt, which should cause your Pi to revert to the old way of
doing things after a reboot.

In /boot you will find a .dtb for each base platform. This describes the
hardware that is part of the Raspberry Pi board. The loader (start.elf and its
siblings) selects the .dtb file appropriate for the platform by name, and reads
it into memory. At this point, all of the optional interfaces (i2c, i2s, spi)
are disabled, but they can be enabled using Device Tree parameters:

    dtparam=i2c=on,i2s=on,spi=on

However, this shouldn't be necessary in many use cases because loading an
overlay that requires one of those interfaces will cause it to be enabled
automatically, and it is advisable to only enable interfaces if they are
needed.

Configuring additional, optional hardware is done using Device Tree overlays
(see below).

GPIO numbering uses the hardware pin numbering scheme (aka BCM scheme) and
not the physical pin numbers.

raspi-config
============

The Advanced Options section of the raspi-config utility can enable and disable
Device Tree use, as well as toggling the I2C and SPI interfaces. Note that it
is possible to both enable an interface and blacklist the driver, if for some
reason you should want to defer the loading.

Modules
=======

As well as describing the hardware, Device Tree also gives enough information
to allow suitable driver modules to be located and loaded, with the corollary
that unneeded modules are not loaded. As a result it should be possible to
remove lines from /etc/modules, and /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf can
have its contents deleted (or commented out).

Using Overlays
==============

Overlays are loaded using the "dtoverlay" config.txt setting. As an example,
consider I2C Real Time Clock drivers. In the pre-DT world these would be loaded
by writing a magic string comprising a device identifier and an I2C address to
a special file in /sys/class/i2c-adapter, having first loaded the driver for
the I2C interface and the RTC device - something like this:

    modprobe i2c-bcm2835
    modprobe rtc-ds1307
    echo ds1307 0x68 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/new_device

With DT enabled, this becomes a line in config.txt:

    dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds1307

This causes the file /boot/overlays/i2c-rtc.dtbo to be loaded and a "node"
describing the DS1307 I2C device to be added to the Device Tree for the Pi. By
default it usees address 0x68, but this can be modified with an additional DT
parameter:

    dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds1307,addr=0x68

Parameters usually have default values, although certain parameters are
mandatory. See the list of overlays below for a description of the parameters
and their defaults.

Making new Overlays based on existing Overlays
==============================================

Recent overlays have been designed in a more general way, so that they can be
adapted to hardware by changing their parameters. When you have additional
hardware with more than one device of a kind, you end up using the same overlay
multiple times with other parameters, e.g.

    # 2 CAN FD interfaces on spi but with different pins
    dtoverlay=mcp251xfd,spi0-0,interrupt=25
    dtoverlay=mcp251xfd,spi0-1,interrupt=24

    # a realtime clock on i2c
    dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,pcf85063

While this approach does work, it requires knowledge about the hardware design.
It is more feasible to simplify things for the end user by providing a single
overlay as it is done the traditional way.

A new overlay can be generated by using ovmerge utility.
https://github.com/raspberrypi/utils/blob/master/ovmerge/ovmerge

To generate an overlay for the above configuration we pass the configuration
to ovmerge and add the -c flag.

    ovmerge -c mcp251xfd-overlay.dts,spi0-0,interrupt=25 \
               mcp251xfd-overlay.dts,spi0-1,interrupt=24 \
               i2c-rtc-overlay.dts,pcf85063 \
    >> merged-overlay.dts

The -c option writes the command above as a comment into the overlay as
a marker that this overlay is generated and how it was generated.
After compiling the overlay it can be loaded in a single line.

    dtoverlay=merged

It does the same as the original configuration but without parameters.

        strict_gpiod            Return GPIOs to inputs when they are released.
                                If using the gpiod utilities, it is necessary
                                to keep a gpioset running (e.g. with
                                --mode=wait) in order for an output value to

                                (default varies)

                                The value should be a 6-byte hexadecimal value,
                                with or without colon separators, written in the
                                natural (big-endian) order.

        N.B. It is recommended to only enable those interfaces that are needed.
        Leaving all interfaces enabled can lead to unwanted behaviour (i2c_vc
        interfering with Pi Camera, I2S and SPI hogging GPIO pins, etc.)
        Note also that i2c, i2c_arm and i2c_vc are aliases for the physical
        interfaces i2c0 and i2c1. Use of the numeric variants is still possible
        but deprecated because the ARM/VC assignments differ between board
        revisions. The same board-specific mapping applies to i2c_baudrate,
        and the other i2c baudrate parameters.


Name:   act-led
Info:   Pi 3B, 3B+, 3A+ and 4B use a GPIO expander to drive the LEDs which can
        only be accessed from the VPU. There is a special driver for this with a
        separate DT node, which has the unfortunate consequence of breaking the
        act_led_gpio and act_led_activelow dtparams.
        This overlay changes the GPIO controller back to the standard one and
        restores the dtparams.

                                0dB. ie. it can attenuate but not provide
                                gain. For most users, this will be desired
                                as it will prevent clipping. By appending
                                the 24dB_digital_gain parameter, the Digital
                                volume control will allow up to 24dB of
                                gain. If this parameter is enabled, it is the
                                responsibility of the user to ensure that
                                the Digital volume control is set to a value
                                that does not result in clipping/distortion!)

        This works with the Raspberry Pi 7" touchscreen when not being polled
        by the firmware.
        By default the overlay uses the i2c_csi_dsi I2C interface, but this
        can be overridden
        You MUST use either "disable_touchscreen=1" or "ignore_lcd=1" in

Name:   fbtft
Info:   Overlay for SPI-connected displays using the fbtft drivers.

        This overlay seeks to replace the functionality provided by fbtft_device
        which is now gone from the kernel.

        Most displays from fbtft_device have been ported over.
        Example:
          dtoverlay=fbtft,spi0-0,rpi-display,reset_pin=23,dc_pin=24,led_pin=18,rotate=270

        It is also possible to specify the controller (this will use the default
        init sequence in the driver).
        Example:
          dtoverlay=fbtft,spi0-0,ili9341,bgr,reset_pin=23,dc_pin=24,led_pin=18,rotate=270

        For devices on spi1 or spi2, the interfaces should be enabled
        with one of the spi1-1/2/3cs and/or spi2-1/2/3cs overlays.

        The following features of fbtft_device have not been ported over:
        - parallel bus is not supported
        - the init property which overrides the controller initialization
          sequence is not supported as a parameter due to memory limitations in
          the bootloader responsible for applying the overlay.

        See https://github.com/notro/fbtft/wiki/FBTFT-RPI-overlays for how to
        create an overlay.

                                edge generates a charging event and a
                                rising edge generates a discharging event.
                                When this is 0 (active high), this is
                                reversed. The default is 0 (active high)

Name:   gpio-hog
Info:   Activate a "hog" for a GPIO - request that the kernel configures it as
        an output, driven low or high as indicated by the presence or absence
        of the active_low parameter. Note that a hogged GPIO is not available
        to other drivers or for gpioset/gpioget.
Load:   dtoverlay=gpio-hog,<param>=<val>
Params: gpio                    GPIO pin to hog (default 26)
        active_low              If set, the hog drives the GPIO low (defaults
                                to off - the GPIO is driven high)


Name:   gpio-ir
Info:   Use GPIO pin as rc-core style infrared receiver input. The rc-core-
        based gpio_ir_recv driver maps received keys directly to a
        /dev/input/event* device, all decoding is done by the kernel - LIRC is
        not required! The key mapping and other decoding parameters can be
        configured by "ir-keytable" tool.
Load:   dtoverlay=gpio-ir,<param>=<val>
Params: gpio_pin                Input pin number. Default is 18.

                                "0" = non-inverted input (active-high
                                signalling). Default is "1".

        rc-map-name             Default rc keymap (can also be changed by
                                ir-keytable), defaults to "rc-rc6-mce"

        invert                  "1" = invert the output (make it active-low).
                                Default is "0" (active-high).


Name:   gpio-key
Info:   This is a generic overlay for activating GPIO keypresses using
        the gpio-keys library and this dtoverlay. Multiple keys can be
        set up using multiple calls to the overlay for configuring
        additional buttons or joysticks. You can see available keycodes
        at https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.12/include/uapi/
        linux/input-event-codes.h#L64
Load:   dtoverlay=gpio-key,<param>=<val>
Params: gpio                    GPIO pin to trigger on (default 3)
        active_low              When this is 1 (active low), a falling
                                edge generates a key down event and a
                                rising edge generates a key up event.
                                When this is 0 (active high), this is
                                reversed. The default is 1 (active low)

Name:   gpio-led
Info:   This is a generic overlay for activating LEDs (or any other component)
        by a GPIO pin. Multiple LEDs can be set up using multiple calls to the
        overlay. While there are many existing methods to activate LEDs on the
        RPi, this method offers some advantages:
        1) Does not require any userspace programs.
        2) LEDs can be connected to the kernel's led-trigger framework,
           and drive the LED based on triggers such as cpu load, heartbeat,
           kernel panic, key input, timers and others.
        3) LED can be tied to the input state of another GPIO pin.
        4) The LED is setup early during the kernel boot process (useful
           for cpu/heartbeat/panic triggers).

        Typical electrical connection is:
           RPI-GPIO.19  ->  LED  -> 300ohm resister  -> RPI-GND
        The GPIO pin number can be changed with the 'gpio=' parameter.

        To control an LED from userspace, write a 0 or 1 value:
           echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/myled1/brightness
        The 'myled1' name can be changed with the 'label=' parameter.

        To connect the LED to a kernel trigger from userspace:
           echo cpu > /sys/class/leds/myled1/trigger
           echo heartbeat > /sys/class/leds/myled1/trigger
           echo none > /sys/class/leds/myled1/trigger
        To connect the LED to GPIO.26 pin (physical pin 37):
           echo gpio > /sys/class/leds/myled1/trigger
           echo 26 > /sys/class/leds/myled1/gpio
        Available triggers:
           cat /sys/class/leds/myled1/trigger

Load:   dtoverlay=gpio-led,<param>=<val>
Params: gpio                    GPIO pin connected to the LED (default 19)
        label                   The label for this LED. It will appear under
                                /sys/class/leds/<label> . Default 'myled1'.
        trigger                 Set the led-trigger to connect to this LED.
                                default 'none' (LED is user-controlled).
                                Some possible triggers:
                                 cpu - CPU load (all CPUs)
                                 cpu0 - CPU load of first CPU.
                                 mmc - disk activity (all disks)
                                 panic - turn on on kernel panic
                                 heartbeat - indicate system health
                                 gpio - connect to a GPIO input pin (note:
                                        currently the GPIO PIN can not be set
                                        using overlay parameters, must be
                                        done in userspace, see examples above.
        active_low              Set to 1 to turn invert the LED control
                                (writing 0 to /sys/class/leds/XXX/brightness
                                will turn on the GPIO/LED). Default '0'.


Name:   gpio-no-bank0-irq
Info:   Use this overlay to disable GPIO interrupts for GPIOs in bank 0 (0-27),
        which can be useful for UIO drivers.
        N.B. Using this overlay will trigger a kernel WARN during booting, but
        this can safely be ignored - the system should work as expected.
Load:   dtoverlay=gpio-no-bank0-irq
Params: <None>


Name:   gpio-no-irq
Info:   Use this overlay to disable all GPIO interrupts, which can be useful
        for user-space GPIO edge detection systems.
Load:   dtoverlay=gpio-no-irq
Params: <None>


Name:   gpio-poweroff
Info:   Drives a GPIO high or low on poweroff (including halt). Using this
        overlay interferes with the normal power-down sequence, preventing the
        kernel from resetting the SoC (a necessary step in a normal power-off
        or reboot). This also disables the ability to trigger a boot by driving
        GPIO3 low.

        The GPIO starts in an inactive state. At poweroff time it is driven
        active for 100ms, then inactive for 100ms, then active again. It is
        safe to remove the power at any point after the initial activation of
        the GPIO.

        Users of this overlay are required to provide an external mechanism to
        switch off the power supply when signalled - failure to do so results
        in a kernel BUG, increased power consumption and undefined behaviour.
Load:   dtoverlay=gpio-poweroff,<param>=<val>
Params: gpiopin                 GPIO for signalling (default 26)

        active_low              Set if the power control device requires a
                                high->low transition to trigger a power-down.
                                Note that this will require the support of a
                                custom dt-blob.bin to prevent a power-down
                                during the boot process, and that a reboot
                                will also cause the pin to go low.
        input                   Set if the gpio pin should be configured as
                                an input.
        export                  Set to export the configured pin to sysfs
        active_delay_ms         Initial GPIO active period (default 100)
        inactive_delay_ms       Subsequent GPIO inactive period (default 100)
        timeout_ms              Specify (in ms) how long the kernel waits for
                                power-down before issuing a WARN (default 3000).


Name:   gpio-shutdown
Info:   Initiates a shutdown when GPIO pin changes. The given GPIO pin
        is configured as an input key that generates KEY_POWER events.

        This event is handled by systemd-logind by initiating a
        shutdown. Systemd versions older than 225 need an udev rule
        enable listening to the input device:

                ACTION!="REMOVE", SUBSYSTEM=="input", KERNEL=="event*", \
                        SUBSYSTEMS=="platform", DRIVERS=="gpio-keys", \
                        ATTRS{keys}=="116", TAG+="power-switch"

        Alternatively this event can be handled also on systems without
        systemd, just by traditional SysV init daemon. KEY_POWER event
        (keycode 116) needs to be mapped to KeyboardSignal on console
        and then kb::kbrequest inittab action which is triggered by
        KeyboardSignal from console can be configured to issue system
        shutdown. Steps for this configuration are:

            Add following lines to the /etc/console-setup/remap.inc file:

                # Key Power as special keypress
                keycode 116 = KeyboardSignal

            Then add following lines to /etc/inittab file:

                # Action on special keypress (Key Power)
                kb::kbrequest:/sbin/shutdown -t1 -a -h -P now

            And finally reload configuration by calling following commands:

                # dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
                # service console-setup reload
                # init q

        This overlay only handles shutdown. After shutdown, the system
        can be powered up again by driving GPIO3 low. The default
        configuration uses GPIO3 with a pullup, so if you connect a
        button between GPIO3 and GND (pin 5 and 6 on the 40-pin header),
        you get a shutdown and power-up button. Please note that
        Raspberry Pi 1 Model B rev 1 uses GPIO1 instead of GPIO3.
Load:   dtoverlay=gpio-shutdown,<param>=<val>
Params: gpio_pin                GPIO pin to trigger on (default 3)
                                For Raspberry Pi 1 Model B rev 1 set this
                                explicitly to value 1, e.g.:

                                    dtoverlay=gpio-shutdown,gpio_pin=1

        active_low              When this is 1 (active low), a falling
                                edge generates a key down event and a
                                rising edge generates a key up event.
                                When this is 0 (active high), this is
                                reversed. The default is 1 (active low).

        gpio_pull               Desired pull-up/down state (off, down, up)
                                Default is "up".

                                Note that the default pin (GPIO3) has an
                                external pullup. Same applies for GPIO1
                                on Raspberry Pi 1 Model B rev 1.

Info:   Change i2c0 pin usage. Not all pin combinations are usable on all
        platforms - platforms other then Compute Modules can only use this
        to disable transaction combining.
        Do NOT use in conjunction with dtparam=i2c_vc=on. From the 5.4 kernel
        onwards the base DT includes the use of i2c_mux_pinctrl to expose two
        muxings of BSC0 - GPIOs 0&1, and whichever combination is used for the
        camera and display connectors. This overlay disables that mux and
        configures /dev/i2c0 to point at whichever set of pins is requested.
        dtparam=i2c_vc=on will try and enable the mux, so combining the two
        will cause conflicts.

Name:   mipi-dbi-spi
Info:   Overlay for SPI-connected MIPI DBI displays using the panel-mipi-dbi
        driver. The driver will load a file /lib/firmware/panel.bin containing
        the initialisation commands.

        Example:
          dtoverlay=mipi-dbi-spi,spi0-0,speed=70000000
          dtparam=width=320,height=240
          dtparam=reset-gpio=23,dc-gpio=24
          dtparam=backlight-gpio=18

        Compared to fbtft panel-mipi-dbi runs pixel data at spi-max-frequency
        and init commands at 10MHz. This makes it possible to push the envelope
        without messing up the controller configuration due to command
        transmission errors.

        For devices on spi1 or spi2, the interfaces should be enabled
        with one of the spi1-1/2/3cs and/or spi2-1/2/3cs overlays.

        See https://github.com/notro/panel-mipi-dbi/wiki for more info.

Params: 24db_digital_gain       Allow gain to be applied via the PCM512x codec
                                digital volume control. Enable by adding

                                The default behaviour is that the digital
                                volume control is limited to a maximum of
                                0dB. ie. it can attenuate but not provide
                                gain. For most users, this will be desired
                                as it will prevent clipping. By appending
                                the 24db_digital_gain parameter, the digital
                                volume control will allow up to 24dB of
                                gain. If this parameter is enabled, it is the

        i2c_baudrate=400000 will speed up the display.

        i2c_baudrate=1000000 seems to work even though it's not officially
        supported by the hardware, and is faster still.

          fbtft/fb_ili9341: dtoverlay=watterott-display
          drm/mi0283qt: dtoverlay=watterott-display,drm,backlight-pwm,rotate=180

        Some notable differences with the DRM driver compared to fbtft:
        - The display is turned on when it's first used and not on driver load
          as with fbtft. So if nothing uses the display it stays off.
        - Can run with a higher SPI clock increasing framerate. This is possible
          since the driver avoids messing up the controller configuration due to
          transmission errors by running config commands at 10MHz and only pixel
          data at full speed (occasional pixel glitch might occur).
        - PWM backlight is supported.

Load:   dtoverlay=watterott-display,<param>=<val>
Params: speed                   Display SPI bus speed
        rotate                  Display rotation {0,90,180,270}
        fps                     Delay between frame updates (fbtft only)
        debug                   Debug output level {0-7} (fbtft only)
        xohms                   Touchpanel sensitivity (X-plate resistance)
        swapxy                  Swap x and y axis
        backlight               Change backlight GPIO pin {e.g. 12, 18}
                                (fbtft only)
        drm                     Use DRM/KMS driver mi0283qt instead of fbtft.
                                Set the SPI clock to 70MHz.
                                This has to be the first parameter.
        backlight-pwm           Use pwm for backlight (drm only). NB: Disables
                                audio headphone output as that also uses PWM.

Troubleshooting
===============

If you are experiencing problems that you think are DT-related, enable DT
diagnostic output by adding this to /boot/config.txt:

    dtdebug=on

and rebooting. Then run:

    sudo vcdbg log msg

and look for relevant messages.

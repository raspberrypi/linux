Introduction
============

This directory contains Device Tree overlays. Device Tree makes it possible
to support many hardware configurations with a single kernel and without the
need to explicitly load or blacklist kernel modules. Note that this isn't a
"pure" Device Tree configuration (c.f. MACH_BCM2835) - some on-board devices
are still configured by the board support code, but the intention is to
eventually reach that goal.

On Raspberry Pi, Device Tree usage is controlled from /boot/config.txt. By
default, the Raspberry Pi kernel boots with device tree enabled. You can
completely disable DT usage (for now) by adding:

    device_tree=

to your config.txt, which should cause your Pi to revert to the old way of
doing things after a reboot.

In /boot you will find a .dtb for each base platform. This describes the
hardware that is part of the Raspberry Pi board. The loader (start.elf and its
siblings) selects the .dtb file appropriate for the platform by name, and reads
it into memory. At this point, all of the optional interfaces (i2c, i2s, spi)
are disabled, but they can be enabled using Device Tree parameters:

    dtparam=i2c=on,i2s=on,spi=on

However, this shouldn't be necessary in many use cases because loading an
overlay that requires one of those interfaces will cause it to be enabled
automatically, and it is advisable to only enable interfaces if they are
needed.

Configuring additional, optional hardware is done using Device Tree overlays
(see below).

GPIO numbering uses the hardware pin numbering scheme (aka BCM scheme) and
not the physical pin numbers.

raspi-config
============

The Advanced Options section of the raspi-config utility can enable and disable
Device Tree use, as well as toggling the I2C and SPI interfaces. Note that it
is possible to both enable an interface and blacklist the driver, if for some
reason you should want to defer the loading.

Modules
=======

As well as describing the hardware, Device Tree also gives enough information
to allow suitable driver modules to be located and loaded, with the corollary
that unneeded modules are not loaded. As a result it should be possible to
remove lines from /etc/modules, and /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf can
have its contents deleted (or commented out).

Using Overlays
==============

Overlays are loaded using the "dtoverlay" config.txt setting. As an example,
consider I2C Real Time Clock drivers. In the pre-DT world these would be loaded
by writing a magic string comprising a device identifier and an I2C address to
a special file in /sys/class/i2c-adapter, having first loaded the driver for
the I2C interface and the RTC device - something like this:

    modprobe i2c-bcm2835
    modprobe rtc-ds1307
    echo ds1307 0x68 > /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/new_device

With DT enabled, this becomes a line in config.txt:

    dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds1307

This causes the file /boot/overlays/i2c-rtc.dtbo to be loaded and a "node"
describing the DS1307 I2C device to be added to the Device Tree for the Pi. By
default it usees address 0x68, but this can be modified with an additional DT
parameter:

    dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds1307,addr=0x68

Parameters usually have default values, although certain parameters are
mandatory. See the list of overlays below for a description of the parameters
and their defaults.

                                (in case you want to connect it to an external
                                device)
                                (default "16" on a non-Plus board, "47" on a
                                Plus or Pi 2)
                                N.B. For Pi3 see pi3-act-led overlay.

        pwr_led_trigger
        pwr_led_activelow
        pwr_led_gpio
                                As for act_led_*, but using the PWR LED.
                                Not available on Model A/B boards.

        N.B. It is recommended to only enable those interfaces that are needed.
        Leaving all interfaces enabled can lead to unwanted behaviour (i2c_vc
        interfering with Pi Camera, I2S and SPI hogging GPIO pins, etc.)
        Note also that i2c, i2c_arm and i2c_vc are aliases for the physical
        interfaces i2c0 and i2c1. Use of the numeric variants is still possible
        but deprecated because the ARM/VC assignments differ between board
        revisions. The same board-specific mapping applies to i2c_baudrate,
        and the other i2c baudrate parameters.

Info:   Use this overlay to disable GPIO interrupts for GPIOs in bank 0 (0-27),
        which can be useful for UIO drivers.

Name:   gpio-poweroff
Info:   Drives a GPIO high or low on poweroff (including halt). Enabling this
        overlay will prevent the ability to boot by driving GPIO3 low.
Load:   dtoverlay=gpio-poweroff,<param>=<val>
Params: gpiopin                 GPIO for signalling (default 26)

        active_low              Set if the power control device requires a
                                high->low transition to trigger a power-down.
                                Note that this will require the support of a
                                custom dt-blob.bin to prevent a power-down
                                during the boot process, and that a reboot
                                will also cause the pin to go low.
        input                   Set if the gpio pin should be configured as
                                an input.
        export                  Set to export the configured pin to sysfs


Name:   gpio-shutdown
Info:   Initiates a shutdown when GPIO pin changes. The given GPIO pin
        is configured as an input key that generates KEY_POWER events.
        This event is handled by systemd-logind by initiating a
        shutdown. Systemd versions older than 225 need an udev rule
        enable listening to the input device:

                ACTION!="REMOVE", SUBSYSTEM=="input", KERNEL=="event*", \
                        SUBSYSTEMS=="platform", DRIVERS=="gpio-keys", \
                        ATTRS{keys}=="116", TAG+="power-switch"

        This overlay only handles shutdown. After shutdown, the system
        can be powered up again by driving GPIO3 low. The default
        configuration uses GPIO3 with a pullup, so if you connect a
        button between GPIO3 and GND (pin 5 and 6 on the 40-pin header),
        you get a shutdown and power-up button.

                                rising edge generates a key up event.
                                When this is 0 (active high), this is
                                reversed. The default is 1 (active low).

        gpio_pull               Desired pull-up/down state (off, down, up)
                                Default is "up".

Name:   pi3-act-led
Info:   Pi3 uses a GPIO expander to drive the LEDs which can only be accessed
        from the VPU. There is a special driver for this with a separate DT
        node, which has the unfortunate consequence of breaking the
        act_led_gpio and act_led_activelow dtparams.
        This overlay changes the GPIO controller back to the standard one and
        restores the dtparams.

        doesn't use the UART, use 'sudo systemctl disable hciuart'.

Name:   pi3-miniuart-bt
Info:   Switch Pi3 Bluetooth function to use the mini-UART (ttyS0) and restore
        UART0/ttyAMA0 over GPIOs 14 & 15. Note that this may reduce the maximum
        usable baudrate.
        N.B. It is also necessary to edit /lib/systemd/system/hciuart.service
        and replace ttyAMA0 with ttyS0, unless you have a system with udev rules
        that create /dev/serial0 and /dev/serial1, in which case use
        /dev/serial1 instead because it will always be correct. Furthermore,
        you must also set core_freq=250 in config.txt or the miniuart will not
        work.

                                The values have the following meaning:
                                1: Full-period mode (default)
                                2: Half-period mode

                                encoder. Only relevant for absolute axis.
                                Defaults to 24 which is a typical value for
                                such devices.

Troubleshooting
===============

If you are experiencing problems that you think are DT-related, enable DT
diagnostic output by adding this to /boot/config.txt:

    dtdebug=on

and rebooting. Then run:

    sudo vcdbg log msg

and look for relevant messages.

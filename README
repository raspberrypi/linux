Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

"make config"      Plain text interface.

"make menuconfig"  Text based color menus, radiolists & dialogs.

"make nconfig"     Enhanced text based color menus.

"make xconfig"     Qt based configuration tool.

"make gconfig"     GTK+ based configuration tool.

"make oldconfig"   Default all questions based on the contents of
                   your existing ./.config file and asking about
                   new config symbols.

"make olddefconfig"
                   Like above, but sets new symbols to their default
                   values without prompting.

"make defconfig"   Create a ./.config file by using the default
                   symbol values from either arch/$ARCH/defconfig
                   or arch/$ARCH/configs/${PLATFORM}_defconfig,
                   depending on the architecture.

"make ${PLATFORM}_defconfig"
                   Create a ./.config file by using the default
                   symbol values from
                   arch/$ARCH/configs/${PLATFORM}_defconfig.
                   Use "make help" to get a list of all available
                   platforms of your architecture.

"make allyesconfig"
                   Create a ./.config file by setting symbol
                   values to 'y' as much as possible.

"make allmodconfig"
                   Create a ./.config file by setting symbol
                   values to 'm' as much as possible.

"make allnoconfig" Create a ./.config file by setting symbol
                   values to 'n' as much as possible.

"make randconfig"  Create a ./.config file by setting symbol
                   values to random values.

"make localmodconfig" Create a config based on current config and
                      loaded modules (lsmod). Disables any module
                      option that is not needed for the loaded modules.

                      To create a localmodconfig for another machine,
                      store the lsmod of that machine into a file
                      and pass it in as a LSMOD parameter.

              target$ lsmod > /tmp/mylsmod
              target$ scp /tmp/mylsmod host:/tmp

              host$ make LSMOD=/tmp/mylsmod localmodconfig

                      The above also works when cross compiling.

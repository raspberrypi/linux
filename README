Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

Compilation
===========

First install Git and the build dependencies:

```sudo apt install git bc bison flex libssl-dev make```

Apply the Default Configuration Pi4 32-bit:

```KERNEL=kernel7l```
```make bcm2711_defconfig```

Apply the Default Configuration Pi4 64-bit:

```KERNEL=kernel8```
```make bcm2711_defconfig```

Customising the Kernel Version Using LOCALVERSION:

```CONFIG_LOCALVERSION="-v7l-MY_CUSTOM_KERNEL"```

Building the Kernel locally Pi4 32-bits:

```
make -j4 zImage modules dtbs
sudo make modules_install
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dtb /boot/
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* /boot/overlays/
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/README /boot/overlays/
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/zImage /boot/$KERNEL.img
```

Building the Kernel locally Pi4 64-bits:

```
make -j4 Image modules dtbs
sudo make modules_install
sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/broadcom/*.dtb /boot/
sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* /boot/overlays/
sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/overlays/README /boot/overlays/
sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/Image /boot/$KERNEL.img
```
